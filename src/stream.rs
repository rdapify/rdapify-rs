//! Async streaming API for batch RDAP queries.
//!
//! The `stream_domain` and `stream_ip` methods on [`crate::RdapClient`]
//! return [`tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream`] values that yield events
//! as results arrive.
//!
//! # Back-pressure
//! Each stream is backed by a bounded [`tokio::sync::mpsc`] channel.
//! [`StreamConfig::buffer_size`] controls the channel capacity — when the
//! buffer is full the producer will wait until the consumer has read at least
//! one item, providing natural back-pressure.
//!
//! # Cancellation
//! Dropping the stream before it is exhausted is safe: the background task
//! that performs the queries detects the closed channel and exits cleanly,
//! without leaking any resources.
